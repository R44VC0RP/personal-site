# Building Inbound: Programmable Email Infrastructure

When I started building Inbound, I had a simple goal: make email infrastructure as easy to use as any modern API.

## The Problem

Most email services are either:
1. Too complex for simple use cases
2. Too limited for advanced workflows
3. Not developer-friendly

## The Solution

Inbound provides a simple API for:
- Sending transactional emails
- Receiving emails via webhooks
- Threading conversations
- Managing multiple domains
